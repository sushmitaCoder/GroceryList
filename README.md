# Grocery List - Javascript Project

### This project is a tutorial on how to update and delete items from a grocery list and create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application.

CRUD plays a very important role in developing full stack applications. Without it, you wouldn't be able to edit or delete posts on your favorite social media platform.  

## Key concepts covered:

- DOMContentLoaded
- new Date()
- createAttribute()
- setAttributeNode()
- appendChild()
- filter()
- map()
